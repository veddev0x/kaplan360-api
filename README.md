# kaplan360-api
kaplan360-api is an unofficial REST API for the Kaplan360 mobile application, I painstainly reverse-engineered the mobile application, and looked through dozens of OpenAM/OpenIDM knowledgebase for 1-2 weeks to chain the private API requests. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and uses ES6 syntax and Async-Await/Promise for code clarity and performance.

kaplan360-api offers a few key features:  
- Straight-forward Basic authentication, no handling of complex multiple-chaining OAuth2 and OpenAM/OpenIDM REST API. 
- Extended Classroom Schedule, from the first session to last session! **(coming soon)**
- Extended Attendance Status, view previous month and further! **(coming soon)**
- Raw Profile Info.  **(coming soon)**
- Totally asynchronous and non-blocking code, up to 4X faster than the mobile application.
