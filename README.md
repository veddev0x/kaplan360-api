# kaplan360-api
kaplan360-api is an unofficial REST API for the Kaplan360 mobile application, I painstainly reversed the mobile application and looked through dozens of OpenAM/OpenIDM knowledgebase for 1-2 weeks. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and uses ES6 syntax and Async-Await/Promise for code clarity and performance.

kaplan360-api offers a few key features:  
- Straight-forward Basic authentication, no handling of complex multiple-chaining OAuth2 and OpenAM/OpenIDM REST API. 
- Extended Classroom Schedule data, up to a month!
- Extended Attendance Status, view previous month and further!
